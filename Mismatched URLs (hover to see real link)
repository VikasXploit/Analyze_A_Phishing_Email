A mismatched URL (aka a spoofed link) is when the text of a link says one thing, but the real destination (the href) is something else — often a malicious or unrelated site.
For example:

What it looks like in the email:

Click here to claim your AAA Emergency Kit
https://aaa.com/freekit

But the real link (when you hover):

http://malicious-site.clicktracker.biz/redirect/AAA-scam

This is exactly how phishing works — visually trustworthy, but secretly malicious.

===============================
MISMATCHED URL CHECK
===============================

Description:
------------
This email claims to be from "AAA_Emergency_Kit_Offer" and offers a "Free Car Emergency Kit". 
However, the sending domain is not affiliated with AAA.

Sender Info:
------------
From: 'AAA_Emergency_Kit_Offer' <hygdx@datastreamgalaxy.uk.net>
Return-Path: <335-978980@datastreamgalaxy.uk.net>
Domain: datastreamgalaxy.uk.net (not related to AAA)

DKIM / SPF / DMARC:
-------------------
- SPF: PASS
- DKIM: PASS (for datastreamgalaxy.uk.net)
- DMARC: FAIL

Analysis:
---------
The email likely includes HTML links that:
- Appear to be from a trusted source (e.g., AAA)
- Actually redirect to unrelated or suspicious domains such as:
  - datastreamgalaxy.uk.net
  - tracking or clickthrough URLs hosted on third-party services

⚠️ Mismatched URLs Expected:
-----------------------------
No clickable links were shown in the plain text part of the email, 
but since the message is multipart/alternative (with an HTML body), 
it likely contains links where:

- Displayed Text: "Click here to claim your AAA Emergency Kit"
- Actual URL: http://datastreamgalaxy.uk.net/click?redirect=...

Recommendation:
---------------
1. Never click links from unknown or suspicious sources.
2. Always hover over links in emails to verify the actual destination.
3. If the visible link text does not match the URL it points to, treat the email as phishing.
4. Report and delete the message.

Conclusion:
-----------
⚠️ High likelihood of mismatched (spoofed) URLs present in HTML version. This is a classic phishing technique.
