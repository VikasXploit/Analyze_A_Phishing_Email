Phishing traits found

Display-name spoofing
Sender shows AAA_Emergency_Kit_Offer (tries to look like AAA) while the actual sending domain is datastreamgalaxy.uk.net — classic impersonation.

Suspicious sending domain / Return-Path mismatch
Return-Path / From domains (datastreamgalaxy.uk.net, 73f8lwldbx3.datastreamgalaxy.uk.net) are unrelated to AAA and look random/throwaway.

DMARC failure (while SPF/DKIM pass)

SPF: PASS, DKIM: PASS, but DMARC: FAIL — indicates authentication is not aligned and the message is not authorized by the purported domain owner. Very suspicious.

Message-ID/domain spoofing
Message-ID uses convertkit-mail2.com while other headers use datastreamgalaxy.uk.net — inconsistent mail identities.

Unusual host / infrastructure hints
Mail received from 164.132.51.132 (OVH VPS / cloud host) and domains like cloudllineh.com.tr/zwimpad.com — often used by bulk/spam senders.

Urgency / reward social engineering in subject
Subject: vikaspalid2004! -Summer Must-Have – Free Car Emergency Kit ⚡. ID#2043 — personalized, urgent, “free” reward + emoji to trigger click-throughs.

Likely mismatched/hidden links (HTML part)
Email is multipart/alternative (plain + HTML). No links appear in the plain text, so malicious links are likely hidden in the HTML (display text that looks legitimate but href points to datastreamgalaxy... or tracking redirects).

Broken / suspicious content in body
Text body contains nonsense / placeholders: Sep 0, 2019, 103882302891885308, and a truncated unsubscrib= — indicates mass/template spam or poorly constructed phishing template.

Tracking / personalization tokens
Long numeric ID present (103882302891885308) and ID#2043 in subject — typical tracking or personalization tokens used by phishing campaigns.

Use of clickable unsubscribe / reply obfuscation
Truncated unsubscribe text and multiple sender headers (Sender, From, X-Google-Sender-Delegation) — attempt to look legitimate while hiding true origin.

Risk level

High — multiple strong indicators of phishing / scam.
